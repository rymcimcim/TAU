When set arguments to 8.45454 and 3
Then multiplication should give 25.36

When set arguments to 45.0001 and 1.0000
Then division should give 45.00

When set arguments to 4.02 and 4.01
Then comparison should give true

When set arguments to 4.00 and 4.01
Then comparison should give false

When 1 gets divided by ZERO
